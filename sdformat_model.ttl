The orientation of the IMU's reference frame is defined by adding the custom_rpy rotation to the parent_frame. - NED: The IMU XYZ aligns with NED, where NED orientation relative to Gazebo world is defined by the SphericalCoordinates class. - ENU: The IMU XYZ aligns with ENU, where ENU orientation relative to Gazebo world is defined by the SphericalCoordinates class. - NWU: The IMU XYZ aligns with NWU, where NWU orientation relative to Gazebo world is defined by the SphericalCoordinates class. - GRAV_UP: where direction of gravity maps to IMU reference frame Z-axis with Z-axis pointing in the opposite direction of gravity. IMU reference frame X-axis direction is defined by grav_dir_x. Note if grav_dir_x is parallel to gravity direction, this configuration fails. Otherwise, IMU reference frame X-axis is defined by projection of grav_dir_x onto a plane normal to the gravity vector. IMU reference frame Y-axis is a vector orthogonal to both X and Z axis following the right hand rule. - GRAV_DOWN: where direction of gravity maps to IMU reference frame Z-axis with Z-axis pointing in the direction of gravity. IMU reference frame X-axis direction is defined by grav_dir_x. Note if grav_dir_x is parallel to gravity direction, this configuration fails.

Some common examples are: - IMU reports in its local frame on boot. IMU sensor frame is the reference frame. Example: parent_frame=\\"\\", custom_rpy=\\"0 0 0\\" - IMU reports in Gazebo world frame. Example sdf: parent_frame=\\"world\\", custom_rpy=\\"0 0 0\\" - IMU reports in NWU frame. Uses SphericalCoordinates class to determine world frame in relation to magnetic north and gravity; i.e. rotation between North-West-Up and world (+X,+Y,+Z) frame is defined by SphericalCoordinates class. Example sdf given world is NWU: parent_frame=\\"world\\", custom_rpy=\\"0 0 0\\" - IMU reports in NED frame. Uses SphericalCoordinates class to determine world frame in relation to magnetic north and gravity; i.e. rotation between North-East-Down and world (+X,+Y,+Z) frame is defined by SphericalCoordinates class. Example sdf given world is NWU: parent_frame=\\"world\\", custom_rpy=\\"M_PI 0 0\\" - IMU reports in ENU frame.

Example sdf given world is NWU: parent_frame=\\"world\\", custom_rpy=\\"0 0 -0.5*M_PI\\" - IMU reports in ROS optical frame as described in http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html#suffix-frames, which is (z-forward, x-left to right when facing +z, y-top to bottom when facing +z).

The orientation of the IMU's reference frame is defined by adding the custom_rpy rotation to the parent_frame. - NED: The IMU XYZ aligns with NED, where NED orientation relative to Gazebo world is defined by the SphericalCoordinates class. - ENU: The IMU XYZ aligns with ENU, where ENU orientation relative to Gazebo world is defined by the SphericalCoordinates class. - NWU: The IMU XYZ aligns with NWU, where NWU orientation relative to Gazebo world is defined by the SphericalCoordinates class. - GRAV_UP: where direction of gravity maps to IMU reference frame Z-axis with Z-axis pointing in the opposite direction of gravity. IMU reference frame X-axis direction is defined by grav_dir_x. Note if grav_dir_x is parallel to gravity direction, this configuration fails. Otherwise, IMU reference frame X-axis is defined by projection of grav_dir_x onto a plane normal to the gravity vector. IMU reference frame Y-axis is a vector orthogonal to both X and Z axis following the right hand rule. - GRAV_DOWN: where direction of gravity maps to IMU reference frame Z-axis with Z-axis pointing in the direction of gravity. IMU reference frame X-axis direction is defined by grav_dir_x. Note if grav_dir_x is parallel to gravity direction, this configuration fails.

    rdfs:comment "This field and parent_frame are used when localization is set to CUSTOM. Orientation (fixed axis roll, pitch yaw) transform from parent_frame to this IMU's reference frame. Some common examples are: - IMU reports in its local frame on boot. IMU sensor frame is the reference frame. Example: parent_frame=\\"\\", custom_rpy=\\"0 0 0\\" - IMU reports in Gazebo world frame. Example sdf: parent_frame=\\"world\\", custom_rpy=\\"0 0 0\\" - IMU reports in NWU frame. Uses SphericalCoordinates class to determine world frame in relation to magnetic north and gravity; i.e. rotation between North-West-Up and world (+X,+Y,+Z) frame is defined by SphericalCoordinates class. Example sdf given world is NWU: parent_frame=\\"world\\", custom_rpy=\\"0 0 0\\" - IMU reports in NED frame. Uses SphericalCoordinates class to determine world frame in relation to magnetic north and gravity; i.e. rotation between North-East-Down and world (+X,+Y,+Z) frame is defined by SphericalCoordinates class. Example sdf given world is NWU: parent_frame=\\"world\\", custom_rpy=\\"M_PI 0 0\\" - IMU reports in ENU frame. Uses SphericalCoordinates class to determine world frame in relation to magnetic north and gravity; i.e. rotation between East-North-Up and world (+X,+Y,+Z) frame is defined by SphericalCoordinates class. Example sdf given world is NWU: parent_frame=\\"world\\", custom_rpy=\\"0 0 -0.5*M_PI\\" - IMU reports in ROS optical frame as described in http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html#suffix-frames, which is (z-forward, x-left to right when facing +z, y-top to bottom when facing +z).
